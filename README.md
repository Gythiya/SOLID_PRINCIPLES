# SOLID Principles – Food Ordering System

## 📌 What is SOLID?
SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles that help developers write code that is clean, maintainable, scalable, and easy to extend.

---

## 🔹 SOLID Principles

### S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one responsibility and one reason to change.

### O – Open–Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting program correctness.

### I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

### D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

## 🍔 Food Ordering System – SOLID Implementation

This project implements a **Food Ordering System** by applying all five SOLID principles.  
The system separates responsibilities clearly, supports easy extension of payment methods, avoids tight coupling through interfaces, and uses dependency injection to create a flexible and maintainable design.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
Applying SOLID principles results in code that is easier to understand, extend, test, and maintain.
